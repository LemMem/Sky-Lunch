# Sky-Lunch

Features to add in the future:
- Multiplayer
- Leaderboards

Things to point out:
- Yes, I know the player sprite is weird, but thats unity's fault.
- I know you can go offscreen left and right, but there are invisible walls, so you won't go far
- No you can't play it on the site that comes with every github site, because it won't work. you can find the link to play it in the releases.
